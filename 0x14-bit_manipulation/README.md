#0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the concepts of bit manipulation. Bit manipulation is the process of manipulating individual bits of a binary number to achieve desired results. It is a fundamental concept in low-level programming and is often used in various applications like embedded systems, graphics, cryptography, etc.
